# Learning Angular From Zero To Hero
 Hi everyone, here is a repo I made to document my Angular journey, I would be updating this repo from time to time showing what I have learnt... Let's go.


 ## What is Angular?

 Angular is a frontend framework for building web applications. It is a framework that is was built using **Typescript** which allows us to write clean and strict codes. 


## What I have learnt so far..

1. Folder navigations
2. Command line operations using ng
3. Templates, Directives, Modules, Dependency injection, Services, Lifecycle hooks, passing data from parent components to child components.
4. Two way binding using ngModel
5. Importing Bootstrap into my project.
   

## Projects to build 

1. A book purchase store.
2. A real time chat application with firebase.
